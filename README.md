# Prime-Fibonacci
Calculates primality of fibonacci numbers


Change the iterative value and recursive value to see different run times of finding fibonacci runbers iteratively and recursively. Program initially tells you run times and prime numbers up to a point determined by me. Could easily be changed to account for a user inputted number and user spcific tasks.
