# Prime-Fibonacci
Calculates primality of fibonacci numbers


Change the iterative value and recursive value to see different run times of finding fibonacci runbers iteratively and recursively. Program initially tells you run times and prime numbers up to a point determined by me. Could easily be changed to account for a user inputted number and user spcific tasks. It may seem as though the computer has entered an infinte loop but it takes up to 20 seconds, depending on the machine, to find these larger value. It is designed to stop after the 12th prime Fibonacci number has been found. That usually takes 11 seconds on my personal computer.
